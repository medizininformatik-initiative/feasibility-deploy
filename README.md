# Feasibility Deploy

[![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-5.4.5-green.svg)](https://github.com/medizininformatik-initiative/feasibility-deploy/releases)

This feasibility deployment repository offers an example deployment repository using docker-compose and official images to set up a feasibility portal (central) as well as feasibility triangle (decentral - at site)

It is divided into two parts:

A feasibility portal part, which creates a deployment of the centralized components necessary for the deployment of the decentralized feasibility query tool.

A feasibility triangle part, which provides a deployment for the decentralized components.


## Feasibility Portal (central)

See: `feasibility-portal/README.md` of this repository.

## Feasibility Triangle (decentral)

See: `feasibility-triangle/README.md` of this repository.
